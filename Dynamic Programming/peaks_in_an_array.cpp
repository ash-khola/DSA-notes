// A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

// For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.
// In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.
// A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

// Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.

// Basicall find the no of peaks (both up and down) in an array(first and last elements can also be considered as peak).

int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
    int peak = 1, valley = 1;

    for(int i = 1; i <nums.size(); i++) {
        if(nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) peak = valley + 1;
        else if(nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) valley = peak + 1;
    }

    return max(peak, valley);
